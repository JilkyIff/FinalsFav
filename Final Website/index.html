        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/"><img alt="Left 4 Dead 2 Cover" id="Left4Dead" src="left4dead2.png" style="width:100%"></a>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Left 4 Dead 2</h1>
      <p>Left 4 Dead 2 is a co-op first-person shooter where you play as immune survivors of a zombie plague; Coach, Ellis, Nick, and Rochelle, fighting through relentless hordes of zombies. Each campaign, styled like a horror movie, takes you through apocalyptic scenarios with unique chapters with different lengths, requiring you to reach safe zones while scavenging supplies and completing tasks. What makes this game good is its attention to detail where every zombie has unique animations, from stumbling over obstacles to reacting to precise injuries with different weapons, making the world feel more immersive. Zombies spawn everywhere you don’t look which keeps up the non-stop action, while special infected bring their own unique AI and sound cues, stalking players, ambushing at close range, or dragging you into hordes.</p>

        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/"><img alt="Cover of Binding of Isaac: Repentance" id="isaac" src="bindingofisaac.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Binding of Isaac</h1>
      <p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a single player top down RPG shooter with heavy rogue-like inspiration where you play as a kid named Isaac, who’s trying to escape his mom by going further down the basement and defeating monsters that lurk in each room. I love this game because it has near infinite replayability with the gameplay loop where the more you play, the more you unlock and the more fun your future runs become. The DLCs are absolutely worth the price and make the game even more replayable, especially with repentance which adds an entire new path to go down with new bosses, enemies, and a whole line of characters.</p>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/"><img alt="Life is Strange Cover" id="strage" src="lifeisstrange.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Life is Strange</h1>
      <p>Life is Strange is an episodic adventure game where you make choices throughout the game that impact the way the story goes. You play as a college student named Max and she has the ability to rewind time and go into the past by looking into polaroids. I like the game because I generally enjoy anything revolving around the butterfly effect and you’ll always be losing something in the end and how you get there is entirely up to you.</p>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us"><img alt="Minecraft Cover" id="mine" src="minecraft.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Minecraft</h1>
      <p>Minecraft is a survival sandbox plain and simple. You play as Alex or Steve and adventure around the world, building beautiful structures, killing mobs, and anything you want. What makes this game pretty unique is the ability to draw you back in, even if only making a server with your friends for 2 weeks, you’ll always come back eventually and it’s usually a good time. The game is super moddable and makes the experience even more fun since you can add more dimensions, items, bosses, etc.</p>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/Monster_Hunter_World/"><img alt="Monster Hunter:World Cover" id="monster" src="monsterhunter.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Monster Hunter: World</h1>
      <p>Monster Hunter: World is an action RPG where you play as a hunter and go out tracking and hunting down monsters, a simple concept that was very well done. The world building, monster fights, weapons, customization, music, all of it is incredibly fun and immersive. Each weapon has a unique playstyle and you’ll always find something for you.</p>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/433340/Slime_Rancher/"><img alt="Slime Rancher Cover" id="superslime" src="slimerancher.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Slime Rancher</h1>
      <p>Slime Rancher is a first-person farming simulator and sandbox exploration game but with slimes! The game has a very positive and bouncy energy that’s guaranteed to make your day whether it be interacting with or mixing slimes together to see the cute combinations, managing your ranch, or just enjoying the pretty aesthetics and views that the game has to offer. The game also has a story you can choose to follow along with if you’d like to know what’s happening and a beautiful soundtrack to match.</p>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/"><img alt="Stadew Valley Cover" id="star" src="stardewvalley.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Stardew Valley</h1>
      <p>Stardew Valley is a farming simulator, roleplay game, and dating sim all in one. The pixel art graphics with the bouncy music match the vibe quite nicely and makes for a very cozy experience when playing single player. Though farming isn’t the only thing you can do as you can fish, mine, fight, explore, find secrets, ranch, and romance the citizens of the little town you stay in, giving you a great experience all the way through with so much content to enjoy every time you think you’ve finished something.</p>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/"><img alt="Terraria Cover" id="terraria" src="terraria.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Terraria</h1>
      <p>Terraria is a 2D action adventure sandbox set in a fun fantasy world with a fully customizable character. It’s a beautifully designed game with fun fights, different classes you can play and explore around with, and an easy to understand progression system where the game gets more difficult the further you go on. The builds you can create in terraria despite it being 2D is baffling since you can even create the illusion of 3D with what you have.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/"><img alt="Undertale Cover" id="undertale" src="undertale.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Undertale</h1>
      <p>Undertale is a choice RPG game with multiple endings based on what you do to the people around you. This game changed the course of my life with the messages and values it teaches you through routes like the pacifist route and learning the stories of the monsters that live down there and what humans had done. The genocide route is chilling and adds a twist to the whole “grinding” mechanic you see in other RPGs where you farm enemies for XP by changing the idea on what XP does.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-half">
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230410/Warframe/"><img alt="Warframe Cover" id="Warframe" src="warframe.png" style="width:100%"></a>
    </div>    
    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Warframe</h1>
      <p>Warframe is a looter shooter game that manages to mix in every genre in this beautifully crafted game. The gameplay is super fast paced, you can play however the hell you want and accomplish things very quickly and the gameplay loop is addictive and keeps you coming back. You want it to be a fishing sim? Go open world and fish. Mortal kombat fighter? Play arcade games. Dating simulator? In the upcoming update for 1990 you’ll have that option. The game also has a beautifully designed soundtrack and top notch vocals, the graphics are unreal for a free-to-play game since it’s on par if not better than games like detroit become human and elden ring but stylized in such a unique way that no other sci-fi could accomplish.</p>
